Skills restribution within tree

Made By Katsero. Sorry for Russian in code, too lazy to translate, let's say you have a translator, right? My apologies

Any way, here is a code that helps to get all wanted soul parts from tree (If you have same ADHD and perfectionism trait).
First list is made if trees and amount of slots you're going to use. Prefereble NOT to touch it, here is my minimal distribution tree (all branches in order from upper one - Illumination.
High use of warps and skips, yet you can any way fill not used slots after the count

Optimised restribution
0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1  
0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1

Next ones are skills you want to obtain from attaching all skills to slots. Preferable is  setting everything to 8 (and you can except the ones obtained from start as I did for Architect)
Keep in mind that you only have 73 skills. If summary of soul parts is more you'll never get the result. And the more hard task might take more time or may not be resultative (Got one of mine on attempt 439402)

Next one is list of skills. All skills | first tree | soul part from first tree | sec tree | sec SP

You can change ammount of attempts on line
'distribution = distribute_skills(tries=1000000)'
If you really need perfect result for ALL 73 skills, lol

That's it. If anyone dares to translate it, my respect to your contribution, comrade
